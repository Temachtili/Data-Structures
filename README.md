# 🧠 Data Structures in Python

This repository contains implementations of classic data structures in Python, including **lists**, **stacks**, **queues**, **trees**, and **graphs**.  
It's designed as a personal reference and educational toolkit, with clean modular code and unit tests for each structure.

> ⚙️ Built from scratch without external libraries — focused on core logic and algorithmic clarity.

## ✅ Implemented Structures

| Category           | Structures                               |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Lists**          | Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List    |
| **Stacks & Queues**| Stack (LIFO), Queue (FIFO), Deque         |
| **Trees**          | Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree           |
| **Graphs**         | Directed Graph, Flow Network              |

## 🧪 Testing

All data structures include basic unit tests under the `/tests` directory.  
To run all tests:

```bash

python -m unittest discover tests
```
> Make sure you're in the project root before running this command.

## 🚧 Future Additions
This project is under active development. Planned additions include:

✅ AVL Trees / Red-Black Trees

✅ Heaps (Min/Max)

✅ Tries

✅ Disjoint Sets

✅ Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Prim, Kruskal)
